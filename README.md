Created using xcode.
OxfordBarCrawl has a list of the bars in Oxford, OH. with a button next to each bar. When you click the button, it changes to a checkmark.
The checkmark can be erased by clicking the button again.
A demonstration can be seen at https://youtu.be/-zGQAdJI3EQ

In the future, I would add background and different ways to sort the list.
